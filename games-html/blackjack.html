        Rules of the Game:
            Objective:
            Player must beat the dealer by having a higher card total without going over 21

            Card Values:
            2 -> 10 = Face Value
            J, Q, K = 10
            Ace = 1 or 11 (only at start, adding more cards resets to 1)

            Definitions:
            Blackjack = an Ace and a card worth 10 points (21 total)
            Hole = the dealer's card that is face down
            Hit = draw another card
            Stand = take no more cards
            Bust = going over 21

            How to Play:
            Players place bets by putting the desired number of chips
            Dealer deals two cards:
                Player gets two visible cards
                Dealer gets one visible card and on hidden (Hole)
            The Dealer asks player each turn if they hit or stand (double or split start only)
            Once the player stands, the dealer reveals their hole card and either hits or stands
            Dealer stops hitting once they reach a card total 17 or higher

            Winning:
            If the Player total is higher than Dealer, 
            Dealer busts 
            If the card total is not higher than 21

            Payouts:
            Blackjack: 2.5x
            Both Player and Dealer get Blackjack: 1x
            Higher Total than Dealer: 2x
            Lower Total than Dealer: 0x

            Optional:
            Can only Double at start:
                Gain one card only and double the bet
            Can split at start
                Get two decks with additional cards, play each deck one by one
